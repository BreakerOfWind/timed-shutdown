# timed-shutdown
Downloading gigabites of games and have to go to sleep? Well this batch file is for you, simply enter the time before shutdown (in seconds) and your PC will wait that long and then shutdown!
Extra note: You do not have to press extract all to run the shutdown file. Also when you open the file it says "Windows protected your PC", but that is only because of an unknown publisher. Don't believe me and think it is a virus (don't blame you)? It is open source so see for yourself in preview.
